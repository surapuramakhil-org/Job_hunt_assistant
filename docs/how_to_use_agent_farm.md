# How to use  
  
1. **Open a Github issue** and write your request â€“ you don't need to be thorough.

3. When you're happy with the agent's work, **merge**.

## Working with Existing Issues

If you already have filed issues in your repository and want Agent Farm to work on them:

1. **Add the `agent-farm` label** to the existing issue you want the agent to work on.
2. Alternatively, **mention `@agent-farm` in a comment** on the issue to trigger the agent.
3. The agent will analyze the issue and open a PR with proposed changes.
4. Continue with steps 2-3 from the basic workflow above.
